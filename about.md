	<p class="intro">Welcome! I’m a postgraduate student currently pursuing a master’s degree in cybersecurity, driven by a deep commitment to protecting digital landscapes and navigating the fast-paced world of Security Operations Centers (SOC).</p>
	<p>My journey has involved hands-on labs, internships, and real-world applications, all of which have equipped me with a strong foundation in SOC practices, network security, and incident detection. I've worked with essential tools like Splunk, Wireshark, Snort, Zeek, and NMAP, and have applied my knowledge through vulnerability assessment projects and network design simulations. A recent project involved setting up a virtual network with isolated subnets, enhancing my practical understanding of network security principles.</p>
	<p>On this website, you’ll find walkthroughs, tutorials, and insights from my cybersecurity studies and professional experiences, including challenges from TryHackMe and my academic projects. My goal is to share knowledge and make cybersecurity accessible for fellow enthusiasts, students, and professionals alike.</p>
	<p>Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to connecting as we explore the world of cybersecurity together!<p>
